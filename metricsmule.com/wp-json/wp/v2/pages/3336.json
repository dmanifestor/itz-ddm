We&#8217;ll hop on a phone or Zoom call for about 30 minutes to discover if we&#8217;ll be a good partner together.

We&#8217;ll conduct in-depth research and analysis strategies specific to your website and campaign.

Each week you&#8217;ll receive comprehensive updates in our project management database, created with Airtable.\u00a0<\/p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\tWhat is SEO Consulting Houston?\n\t\t<\/h2>\n\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\tIs it only for Houston?\n\t\t<\/h3>\n\t<p>SEO consulting is for everyone, not just Houston, Texas.\u00a0 We happen to be located in Houston, TX, but all of these SEO services and blueprints apply to anyone, everywhere, and in any industry. Before creating MetricsMule, we spent 10+ years traveling throughout the United States in just about every major city and visiting other small to mid-size businesses. Our passion is helping businesses grow. Let&#8217;s do it for you!<\/p>\n<strong>So what exactly is SEO consulting, and what does it include?<br \/>\n<\/strong>SEO consulting consists of results-driven and proven strategies that we&#8217;ll implement for your business every month consistently. SEO is a process, and results do not just happen overnight. Each month we&#8217;ll implement these strategies to help you boost your visibility, generate more traffic, and skyrocket your sales and customer reach. Hundreds of people are searching for you and your services every day. Let&#8217;s make sure you can be found.\n<strong>Do you know if your website is set up correctly for SEO?\u00a0 What is technical SEO?<br \/>\n<\/strong>Unfortunately, many people do not know the importance of this. One of the first things we do is make sure your website is optimized for search engines like Google to crawl your website. If they can&#8217;t crawl your website correctly, you&#8217;ll never appear in the search results. These strategies are also known as <a href=\"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/technical-seo\/\">technical SEO<\/a>. This is extremely important.<br \/>\nDo you have a sitemap? How about metadata set up accurately? Or what about your title tags, headings, and page descriptions? These are all features of technical SEO and are very important to implement the correct way.\n<p>Technical SEO is a building block that entails optimizing your website&#8217;s infrastructure that works cohesively with the content and keywords placed within your website. Doing this properly can significantly give your website a boost.<\/p>\n<strong>Responsive Websites for SEO<br \/>\n<\/strong>Having a responsive website is crucial. This is also known as having a mobile-friendly website. In recent years, Google has made this a top priority. If your website is not mobile-friendly, you can actually be penalized by leading search engines. Your website needs to be fully optimized to be used and look good on phones, iPads, etc.\n<strong>Do you have a local business in the Houston area?<br \/>\n<\/strong>If so, see where you are currently ranking. Choose the most important keywords and phrases related to your business and enter them into the Google search bar and see where you appear. Or better yet, see where your competitors appear. Here&#8217;s an example:<br \/>\nLet&#8217;s say you&#8217;re a body shop in Cypress, Texas (77095). Search for a few keyword phrases like this: body shops near me, automotive repair shop Cypress, TX, best collision repair 77095. Get it? It&#8217;s essential to use a variety of keywords and phrases to see where you stack up.\n<strong>Houston Local SEO:<br \/>\n<\/strong>We&#8217;ll use Houston as an example since this is where we&#8217;re located, but the same can apply to you in any city. Perform another search for your business name or your business category, followed by your zip code or city. Do you appear in the <a href=\"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/local-seo\/\">Google My Business<\/a> results? This type of result will appear on the right-hand side of the search results page, usually with a map and a pinpoint of your business, location, and explanation of services. If you don&#8217;t see yourself here, let&#8217;s talk ASAP.\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/calendly.com\/metricsmule\/30min\" target=\"_blank\" role=\"button\" rel=\"noopener\" aria-label=\"Let's Talk!\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLet&#8217;s Talk!\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/target.gif\" alt=\"metricsmule consulting\" itemprop=\"image\" height=\"640\" width=\"640\" title=\"target\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"  \/>\n\t<strong>Keyword Research<br \/>\n<\/strong>Keyword research is the building block of SEO, and when you use MetricsMule for your SEO consulting services, in Houston or otherwise, you&#8217;ll be set up with an amazing database of keyword research, analytics, competitor data, and more with our custom Airtable databases. We personally believe this tool, Airtable, cannot be beaten, and our SEO databases are second to none. We&#8217;ll figure out your most important keywords, your competitor&#8217;s keywords and use them in a way to boost your presence and sales.\n<strong>What is On-Page SEO, and how do you do it?<br \/>\n<\/strong>On-Page SEO is the strategy of optimizing your website to increase online exposure. This involves making changes to your actual website in the form of content, keyword usage, title, tags, headlines, and more. We explain more about <a href=\"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/on-page-seo\/\">on-page optimization here<\/a>.\n<p><strong>A few examples<\/strong> can be high-quality blog posts with internal linking, user-friendly knowledge, and proper use of metadata.<\/p>\n<p>Another thing that is extremely important is <a href=\"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/video-marketing\/\">video.<\/a> It never hurts to have quality YouTube videos on your website. In fact, we always like to create a video archives page (vlog) for your website. Did you know that Google owns YouTube? But not only that, YouTube is the second most visited search engine behind, you guessed it, Google. Try doing a search beginning with &#8220;how-to.&#8221; You&#8217;ll quickly notice that search engines will prioritize high-quality videos and place them on their first page.<\/p>\n<p>However, Google search and YouTube search operate totally differently. A search term that has a volume of 1000 visits per month on Google may only have a volume of 50 visits per month on YouTube. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important to optimize both strategies the right way.<\/p>\n<p>For your videos, you&#8217;ll want to make sure that you appear in the top search results for not only regular search but also Google video search, image search, and YouTube&#8217;s search engine.<\/p>\n<p>Google&#8217;s first page of search results is precious real estate, and often, it can be very hard to appear there (especially if there is a lot of competition for a specific keyword).<\/p>\n<p>There are two ways to increase these chances, however.<\/p>\n1. Google Ads: Create a PPC Ad (pay per click) and set a budget on how much you&#8217;re willing to spend.<br \/>\n2. Create a great video that Google will feature on the first page. This is ideal if done right.\n<strong>MetricsMule does it all.<br \/>\n<\/strong>You only need to go to one place for SEO consulting. Even if you need a promotional video done, we do that too. We&#8217;ll integrate your videos, marketing collateral, SEO data, Google Analytics, Google Ads and Google My Business (Local SEO) altogether. Integration and automation that&#8217;s what we can do. From there, we&#8217;ll teach you exactly how to fish.\n\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/08\/automotive-websites-seo.gif\" alt=\"metricsmule marketing\" itemprop=\"image\" height=\"512\" width=\"512\" title=\"automotive-websites-seo\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"  \/>\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" role=\"button\" rel=\"noopener\" aria-label=\"More about SEO\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tMore about SEO\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/technical-seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" role=\"button\" rel=\"noopener\" aria-label=\"Technical SEO\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tTechnical SEO\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/on-page-seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" role=\"button\" rel=\"noopener\" aria-label=\"On-Page SEO\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tOn-Page SEO\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/video-seo-services\/\" target=\"_blank\" role=\"button\" rel=\"noopener\" aria-label=\"Video SEO \">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tVideo SEO \n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/local-seo\/\" target=\"_blank\" role=\"button\" rel=\"noopener\" aria-label=\"Local SEO\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\tLocal SEO\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\tSEO Consulting Other Features\n\t\t<\/h2>\n\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\tWebsite Audit\n\t\t<\/h3>\n\t\t\t<p>We&#8217;ll kick off the SEO consulting campaign by performing a detailed website audit.

We&#8217;ll then build a comprehensive database using our favorite <a href=\"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/airtable\/\">CRM tool, Airtable.\u00a0<\/a><\/p>\t\t\n\t\t<h3>\n\t\t\tCompetitor&#8217;s Analysis\n\t\t<\/h3>\n\t\t\t<p>Not only do you need to know your SEO and keyword data but it&#8217;s just as important to know your competitor&#8217;s as well.
