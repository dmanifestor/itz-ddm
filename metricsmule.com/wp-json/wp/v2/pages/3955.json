In the prompts that you generate, make sure not to include options, suggestions, or considerations, but instead include concrete directions. Also make sure to write each main section in a natural language format. Everything should be written as if it is describing an image or photo that already exists, and not as directions to a person to create the image from scratch. Every prompt should be unique and not reference back to previously generated prompts. I will provide commands that start with one of these prompts:<\/p>\n<p>* \/photo [arg1],[arg2]&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>* \/art [arg1],[arg2]&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>* \/logo [arg1],[arg2]&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>* \/random [arg1],[arg2]&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>The commands I send will be followed by the following:<\/p>\n<p>* a short description of the subject I want to generate. Any text in the command surrounded by ! is the most important part of the prompt, so highlight those features in the prompt that you generate. Example: A futuristic city !on the moon!, the most important part of the description should focus on &#8220;on the moon&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>* Arguments are optional (as represented by [arg1],[arg2],etc.), but if present follow the instructions as defined below. If there are no arguments in the command, use the default of [medium]<\/p>\n<p>List of possible arguments:<\/p>\n<p>[short] &#8211; the prompt should be very succinct and the length should be less than 25 words.<\/p>\n<p>[medium] &#8211; the prompt should be moderately detailed, and the length should be more than 25 and less than 50 words<\/p>\n<p>[long] &#8211; the prompt should be quite detailed, and the length should be more than 50 and less than 100 words.<\/p>\n<p>[photo] &#8211; used for only \/random, when generating the prompt, include settings and lighting similar to &#8220;\/photo&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>[art] &#8211; used for only \/random, when generating the prompt, include artistic direction and lighting similar to &#8220;\/art&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>[ar X:Y] &#8211; used in the [s1] suffix<\/p>\n<p>[style:X] &#8211; X is a value to be used in the [s2] suffix<\/p>\n<p>[chaos:X] &#8211; X is a value to be used in the [s3] suffix<\/p>\n<p>Below is the format that the prompt you generate should follow, including spacing, with each value replaced with the information described below the example:<\/p>\n<p>Format:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;\/imagine prompt: [d1]<\/p>\n<p>[d2]<\/p>\n<p>[d3]<\/p>\n<p>[s1] [s2] [s3]&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>[d1] &#8211; [d3] are the text of the prompt that you should generate. Do not output the tags, but replace all the placeholders of [d1], [d2], etc. with the text as defined below for each section. Include the spacing as listed in the format example.<\/p>\n<p>[d1] &#8211; a detailed description of the subject that is extrapolated from the text in my command. Add interesting details as necessary to make the scene dynamic. Be as descriptive of the scene as possible, focusing on describing what it visually looks like. depending on the command, tailor the description to match the type of media, such as \/photo, \/art, or \/logo<\/p>\n<p>[d2] &#8211; this is variable, choose the appropriate option below based on the command:<\/p>\n<p>option 1 (\/photo): list out the specific numerical camera settings that are used in the photograph of the subject, written in a natural language, paragraph format. Include specific settings like f-stop, shutter speed, ISO rating, and focal depth. Include any other settings that might be helpful or relevant to describe a photo.<\/p>\n<p>option 2 (\/art): describe the art style used to render the subject. Examples include digital painting, pencil sketch, oil painting, and watercolor, but feel free to suggest other art styles, or combine styles, such as watercolor and ink, or chiaroscuro. Where appropriate, please include stylistic descriptions, related to things like brush strokes, stippling, hatching, etc.<\/p>\n<p>option 3 (\/logo): describe the design style that was used for a logo design that might be appropriate for a corporation, a jacket patch, a website, or something similar.<\/p>\n<p>option 4 (\/random): choose a subject at random, but one that would make a visually interesting composition. generate a prompt in the same style as the others based on the argument provided (e.g. like \/photo for [photo] and like \/art for [art])<\/p>\n<p>[d3] &#8211; provide a detailed description of the volumetric lighting that was used for the composition in a natural language format, choosing options that will compliment the subject. Examples include natural sunlight, light boxes, diffuse light, or a combination of lighting methods.<\/p>\n<p>[s1]-[s3] are suffixes that should be appended to the end of the prompt that you generate with the following formats. Do not reference these arguments in the text of the prompt, but only include their values at the end, as determined by the descriptions below. Always include [s1] and [s2]. Only include [s3] if the argument &#8220;[chaos:x]&#8221; is provided in my command.<\/p>\n<p>[s1] : &#8211;ar X:Y &#8211; this is the aspect ratio setting, so you should replace the numbers X and Y to get an aspect ratio that is appropriate for the subject. Favor standard aspect ratios such as 16:9, 9:16, 4:3, etc. but sometimes try out non-standard aspect ratios. Do not exceed 4:1 or 1:4. if the argument [AR X:Y] is present, use those values for X and Y for the aspect ratio.<\/p>\n<p>[s2] : &#8211;s X &#8211; replace X with an integer between 150-750. This determines how stylistically varied the images will be in the diffusion generator. Weight this towards lower numbers. Always include this suffix, but if the argument [style:X] is present in my command, use the the value for X.<\/p>\n<p>[s3] : &#8211;c X &#8211; only include this suffix the the argument [chaos:X] is present in my command. if it is, use the value of X.<\/p>\n<p>Other commands that we will use in conjunction with the prompts above are listed below, with a description of what they should do.<\/p>\n<p>* \/ban<\/p>\n<p>This command should add any words after the slash command to a &#8220;ban list&#8221; of words that should not be used in the prompts that you generate.<\/p>\n<p>* \/banlist<\/p>\n<p>Show all the words that are currently on your list of banned words.<\/p>\n<p>* \/unban<\/p>\n<p>This command should remove any words after the slash command from the &#8220;ban list&#8221; and allow you to use them again going forward.<\/p>\n<p>Do you understand your instructions?<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t#1 SEO Content Prompt with WebPilot\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>&#8220;Using WebPilot, create an outline for an article that will be 1,500 words on the keyword [keyword, based on the top 10 results from Google.

Your goal is to help me craft the best possible prompt for my needs. The prompt you provide should be written from the perspective of me making the request to ChatGPT. Consider in your prompt creation that this prompt will be entered into an interface for GPT3, GPT4, or ChatGPT. The process is as follows:<\/p>\n<p>1. You will generate the following sections (display sections in Bold using Markdown):<\/p>\n<p>**Prompt:**<br \/>{provide the best possible prompt according to my request. There is no restriction to the length of the prompt. It can be as long as necessary. Display Markdown format using &#8220;&#8221;&gt;&#8221;&#8221;.

This section is intended to force constructive criticism even when the prompt is acceptable. Any assumptions and or issues should be included}<\/p>\n<p>**Questions:**<br \/>{ask any questions pertaining to what additional information is needed from me to improve the prompt (max of 3). If the prompt needs more clarification or details in certain areas, ask questions to get more information to include in the prompt}<\/p>\n<p>2. I will provide my answers to your response which you will then incorporate into your next response using the same format.

And just recently ChatGPT released a plugin that&#8217;s a genius in creating awesome AI Art prompts. It&#8217;s called &#8220;Photorealistic&#8221;. Next time you&#8217;re in GPT-4, activate plugins and search for &#8220;photorealistic&#8221;. You&#8217;ll be happy you did. Below, I&#8217;ll add a video where I demo that ChatGPT plugin.<\/p>\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h5 tabindex=\"0\">ChatGPT, Leonardo AI<\/h5>\n\t\t\t<p>You will now act as a prompt generator for a generative AI called &#8220;&#8221;Leonardo AI&#8221;&#8221;. Leonardo AI generates images based on given prompts. I will provide you basic information required to make a Stable Diffusion prompt, You will never alter the structure in any way and obey the following guidelines.<br \/>Basic information required to make Leonardo AI prompt:<br \/>&#8211; Prompt structure:<br \/>&#8211; Photorealistic Images prompt structure will be in this format &#8220;&#8221;Subject Description in details with as much as information can be provided to describe image, Type of Image, Art Styles, Art Inspirations, Camera, Shot, Render Related Information&#8221;&#8221;<br \/>&#8211; Artistic Image Images prompt structure will be in this format &#8220;&#8221; Type of Image, Subject Description, Art Styles, Art Inspirations, Camera, Shot, Render Related Information&#8221;&#8221;<br \/>&#8211; Word order and effective adjectives matter in the prompt. The subject, action, and specific details should be included. Adjectives like cute, medieval, or futuristic can be effective.<br \/>&#8211; The environment\/background of the image should be described, such as indoor, outdoor, in space, or solid color.<br \/>&#8211; The exact type of image can be specified, such as digital illustration, comic book cover, photograph, or sketch.<br \/>&#8211; Art style-related keywords can be included in the prompt, such as steampunk, surrealism, or abstract expressionism.<br \/>&#8211; Pencil drawing-related terms can also be added, such as cross-hatching or pointillism.<br \/>&#8211; Curly brackets are necessary in the prompt to provide specific details about the subject and action. These details are important for generating a high-quality image.<br \/>&#8211; Art inspirations should be listed to take inspiration from. Platforms like Art Station, Dribble, Behance, and Deviantart can be mentioned. Specific names of artists or studios like animation studios, painters and illustrators, computer games, fashion designers, and film makers can also be listed. If more than one artist is mentioned, the algorithm will create a combination of styles based on all the influencers mentioned.<br \/>&#8211; Related information about lighting, camera angles, render style, resolution, the required level of detail, etc. should be included at the end of the prompt.<br \/>&#8211; Camera shot type, camera lens, and view should be specified. Examples of camera shot types are long shot, close-up, POV, medium shot, extreme close-up, and panoramic. Camera lenses could be EE 70mm, 35mm, 135mm+, 300mm+, 800mm, short telephoto, super telephoto, medium telephoto, macro, wide angle, fish-eye, bokeh, and sharp focus. Examples of views are front, side, back, high angle, low angle, and overhead.<br \/>&#8211; Helpful keywords related to resolution, detail, and lighting are 4K, 8K, 64K, detailed, highly detailed, high resolution, hyper detailed, HDR, UHD, professional, and golden ratio. Examples of lighting are studio lighting, soft light, neon lighting, purple neon lighting, ambient light, ring light, volumetric light, natural light, sun light, sunrays, sun rays coming through window, and nostalgic lighting. Examples of color types are fantasy vivid colors, vivid colors, bright colors, sepia, dark colors, pastel colors, monochromatic, black &amp; white, and color splash. Examples of renders are Octane render, cinematic, low poly, isometric assets, Unreal Engine, Unity Engine, quantum wavetracing, and polarizing filter.<br \/>&#8211; The weight of a keyword can be adjusted by using the syntax (((keyword))) , put only those keyword inside ((())) which is very important because it will have more impact so anything wrong will result in unwanted picture so be careful.<br \/>The prompts you provide will be in English. Please pay attention:- Concepts that can&#8217;t be real would not be described as &#8220;&#8221;Real&#8221;&#8221; or &#8220;&#8221;realistic&#8221;&#8221; or &#8220;&#8221;photo&#8221;&#8221; or a &#8220;&#8221;photograph&#8221;&#8221;. for example, a concept that is made of paper or scenes which are fantasy related.- One of the prompts you generate for each concept must be in a realistic photographic style. you should also choose a lens type and size for it. Don&#8217;t choose an artist for the realistic photography prompts.- Separate the different prompts with two new lines.<br \/>Important points to note :<br \/>1. I will provide you with a keyword and you will generate three different types of prompts with lots of details as given in the prompt structure<br \/>2. Must be in vbnet code block for easy copy-paste and only provide prompt.<br \/>3.

You will write each prompt in one line without using return. Structure of prompt will be in: [1] = [KEYWORD] [2] = a detailed description of [1] that will include very specific imagery details. [3] = with a detailed description describing the environment of the scene. [4] = with a detailed description describing the mood\/feelings and atmosphere of the scene. [5] = A style, for example: photography, painting, illustration, sculpture, Artwork, paperwork, 3d and more). [6] = A description of how [5] will be realized. (e.g. Photography (e.g. Macro, Fisheye Style, Portrait) with camera model and appropriate camera settings, Painting with detailed descriptions about the materials and working material used, rendering with engine settings, a digital Illustration, a woodburn art (and everything else that could be defined as an output type) [7] = Parameters detaills as given below Note don&#8217;t use , when using parameter options and use all important parameter options which is required to generate image. Parameters details start Aspect Ratios (&#8211;aspect or &#8211;ar): Changes the aspect ratio of a generation. &#8211;aspect 5:4: Common frame and print ratio. &#8211;aspect 4:3: Common in television and photography. &#8211;aspect 3:2: Common in print photography. &#8211;aspect 16:9: Common in widescreen television and video. &#8211;aspect 2:1: Common in panoramic photography. &#8211;aspect 7:4: Close to HD TV screens and smartphone screens. &#8211;aspect 9:16: Common in vertical videos and smartphone screens. &#8211;aspect 1:2: Common in portrait-oriented photography. Chaos (&#8211;chaos &lt;number&gt;): Changes how varied the results will be. Higher values produce more unusual and unexpected generations. chaos parameter accepts a number from 0 to 100, where 0 produces very similar and expected results and 100 produces highly varied and unexpected results Negative prompting (&#8211;no): Removes unwanted elements from the image. Quality (&#8211;quality or &#8211;q &lt;.25, .5, 1, or 2&gt;): Controls the rendering quality of the image. Default is 1. Seed (&#8211;seed &lt;integer between 0-4294967295&gt;): Specifies a seed number to generate the initial image grids. Using the same seed number and prompt will produce similar ending images. Stop (&#8211;stop &lt;integer between 10-100&gt;): Finishes a job partway through the process. Stopping a job at an earlier percentage can create blurrier, less detailed results. Model Version (&#8211;version or &#8211;v &lt;1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 5.1&gt;): Uses a different version of the Midjourney algorithm. The current algorithm (V5.1) is the default setting. Stylize (&#8211;stylize &lt;number&gt; or &#8211;s &lt;number&gt;): Influences how strongly Midjourney&#8217;s default aesthetic style is applied to jobs. This parameter accepts a number from 0 to 1000, where 0 produces images that more closely resemble the input prompt and 1000 produces images with the strongest default Midjourney aesthetic style Upscalers (&#8211;uplight, &#8211;upbeta, &#8211;upanime): Adds additional details to the low-resolution image grid. Multiple upscale models are available. Image Weight (&#8211;iw): Sets the image prompt weight relative to text weight. Default value is 0.25. Parameters details End* Use aspect ratio which fits best for the image as per your understading. If [5] looks best in a Japanese art style use, &#8220;&#8221;&#8211;niji 5&#8243;&#8221;.

Your job is to provide detailed and creative descriptions that will inspire unique and interesting images from the AI.<\/p>\n<p>NOTE:<br \/>Keep in mind that the AI is capable of understanding a wide range of language and can interpret abstract concepts, so feel free to be as imaginative and descriptive as possible.<\/p>\n<p>For example, you could describe a scene from a futuristic city, or a surreal landscape filled with strange creatures. The more detailed and imaginative your description, the more interesting the resulting image will be.<\/p>\n<p>Here is your first prompt: &#8220;&#8221;A field of wildflowers stretches out as far as the eye can see, each one a different color and shape. In the distance, a massive tree towers over the landscape, its branches reaching up to the sky like tentacles.&#8221;&#8221;&#8221;<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h5 tabindex=\"0\">Floating City<\/h5>\n\t\t\t<p>&#8220;An expansive floating city in the clouds, featuring gravity-defying structures, aerial walkways, and levitating platforms.<br \/>Modifiers: Ethereal, weightless, majestic, grandeur, celestial, panoramic view, cascading waterfalls, wispy clouds.<br \/>Artist or style inspiration: Tsutomu Nihei, Stephan Martiniere, Floating Islands concept, Art Nouveau influence.<br \/>Technical specifications: Epic landscape painting, wide-angle perspective, soft lighting, attention to atmospheric perspective.&#8221;<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h5 tabindex=\"0\">Hyperrealistic Superhero<\/h5>\n\t\t\t<p>A hyperrealistic, cinematic-still portrait of a superhero, standing in a heroic pose, with a determined expression and a backdrop of a star-filled night sky.<\/p>\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h5 tabindex=\"0\">The Midjourney Everything Prompt<\/h5>\n\t\t\t<p>Please generate prompts for a stable diffusion-based image generator that accepts a description of a photo or piece of art and outputs a detailed paragraph. In the prompts that you generate, make sure not to include options, suggestions, or considerations, but instead include concrete directions. Also make sure to write each main section in a natural language format. Everything should be written as if it is describing an image or photo that already exists, and not as directions to a person to create the image from scratch. Every prompt should be unique and not reference back to previously generated prompts. I will provide commands that start with one of these prompts:<\/p>\n<p>* \/photo [arg1],[arg2]&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>* \/art [arg1],[arg2]&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>* \/logo [arg1],[arg2]&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>* \/random [arg1],[arg2]&#8230;<\/p>\n<p>The commands I send will be followed by the following:<\/p>\n<p>* a short description of the subject I want to generate. Any text in the command surrounded by ! is the most important part of the prompt, so highlight those features in the prompt that you generate. Example: A futuristic city !on the moon!, the most important part of the description should focus on &#8220;on the moon&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>* Arguments are optional (as represented by [arg1],[arg2],etc.), but if present follow the instructions as defined below. If there are no arguments in the command, use the default of [medium]<\/p>\n<p>List of possible arguments:<\/p>\n<p>[short] &#8211; the prompt should be very succinct and the length should be less than 25 words.<\/p>\n<p>[medium] &#8211; the prompt should be moderately detailed, and the length should be more than 25 and less than 50 words<\/p>\n<p>[long] &#8211; the prompt should be quite detailed, and the length should be more than 50 and less than 100 words.<\/p>\n<p>[photo] &#8211; used for only \/random, when generating the prompt, include settings and lighting similar to &#8220;\/photo&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>[art] &#8211; used for only \/random, when generating the prompt, include artistic direction and lighting similar to &#8220;\/art&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>[ar X:Y] &#8211; used in the [s1] suffix<\/p>\n<p>[style:X] &#8211; X is a value to be used in the [s2] suffix<\/p>\n<p>[chaos:X] &#8211; X is a value to be used in the [s3] suffix<\/p>\n<p>Below is the format that the prompt you generate should follow, including spacing, with each value replaced with the information described below the example:<\/p>\n<p>Format:<\/p>\n<p>&#8220;\/imagine prompt: [d1]<\/p>\n<p>[d2]<\/p>\n<p>[d3]<\/p>\n<p>[s1] [s2] [s3]&#8221;<\/p>\n<p>[d1] &#8211; [d3] are the text of the prompt that you should generate. Do not output the tags, but replace all the placeholders of [d1], [d2], etc. with the text as defined below for each section. Include the spacing as listed in the format example.<\/p>\n<p>[d1] &#8211; a detailed description of the subject that is extrapolated from the text in my command. Add interesting details as necessary to make the scene dynamic. Be as descriptive of the scene as possible, focusing on describing what it visually looks like. depending on the command, tailor the description to match the type of media, such as \/photo, \/art, or \/logo<\/p>\n<p>[d2] &#8211; this is variable, choose the appropriate option below based on the command:<\/p>\n<p>option 1 (\/photo): list out the specific numerical camera settings that are used in the photograph of the subject, written in a natural language, paragraph format. Include specific settings like f-stop, shutter speed, ISO rating, and focal depth. Include any other settings that might be helpful or relevant to describe a photo.<\/p>\n<p>option 2 (\/art): describe the art style used to render the subject. Examples include digital painting, pencil sketch, oil painting, and watercolor, but feel free to suggest other art styles, or combine styles, such as watercolor and ink, or chiaroscuro. Where appropriate, please include stylistic descriptions, related to things like brush strokes, stippling, hatching, etc.<\/p>\n<p>option 3 (\/logo): describe the design style that was used for a logo design that might be appropriate for a corporation, a jacket patch, a website, or something similar.<\/p>\n<p>option 4 (\/random): choose a subject at random, but one that would make a visually interesting composition. generate a prompt in the same style as the others based on the argument provided (e.g. like \/photo for [photo] and like \/art for [art])<\/p>\n<p>[d3] &#8211; provide a detailed description of the volumetric lighting that was used for the composition in a natural language format, choosing options that will compliment the subject. Examples include natural sunlight, light boxes, diffuse light, or a combination of lighting methods.<\/p>\n<p>[s1]-[s3] are suffixes that should be appended to the end of the prompt that you generate with the following formats. Do not reference these arguments in the text of the prompt, but only include their values at the end, as determined by the descriptions below. Always include [s1] and [s2]. Only include [s3] if the argument &#8220;[chaos:x]&#8221; is provided in my command.<\/p>\n<p>[s1] : &#8211;ar X:Y &#8211; this is the aspect ratio setting, so you should replace the numbers X and Y to get an aspect ratio that is appropriate for the subject. Favor standard aspect ratios such as 16:9, 9:16, 4:3, etc. but sometimes try out non-standard aspect ratios. Do not exceed 4:1 or 1:4. if the argument [AR X:Y] is present, use those values for X and Y for the aspect ratio.<\/p>\n<p>[s2] : &#8211;s X &#8211; replace X with an integer between 150-750. This determines how stylistically varied the images will be in the diffusion generator. Weight this towards lower numbers. Always include this suffix, but if the argument [style:X] is present in my command, use the the value for X.<\/p>\n<p>[s3] : &#8211;c X &#8211; only include this suffix the the argument [chaos:X] is present in my command. if it is, use the value of X.<\/p>\n<p>Other commands that we will use in conjunction with the prompts above are listed below, with a description of what they should do.<\/p>\n<p>* \/ban<\/p>\n<p>This command should add any words after the slash command to a &#8220;ban list&#8221; of words that should not be used in the prompts that you generate.<\/p>\n<p>* \/banlist<\/p>\n<p>Show all the words that are currently on your list of banned words.<\/p>\n<p>* \/unban<\/p>\n<p>This command should remove any words after the slash command from the &#8220;ban
