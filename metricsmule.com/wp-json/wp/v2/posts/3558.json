These apps and tools are some of our favorites to do just that.\u00a0<\/p>\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/12\/300x300-flyers-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"300x300-flyers-thumbnail\" itemprop=\"image\" height=\"300\" width=\"300\" title=\"300x300-flyers-thumbnail\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"  \/>\n\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/07\/flyer-mock3.jpg\" alt=\"Creative \" itemprop=\"image\" height=\"700\" width=\"1200\" title=\"flyer-mock3\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"  \/>\n\t<p>One of the frustrating things about designing original content is the non-stop search for good ideas and locating tools that provide quality images and videos.<\/p>\n<p>Popular brands spend significant time designing and editing their images or videos &#8212; just like you do when planning your content. So finding a way to create eye-catching designs that pop and demand attention is paramount.<\/p>\n<p>While some stock resources can be expensive, others are incredibly affordable, especially for everything they offer. You also want to ensure you get the most bang for your buck. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;re always looking for stock image and video tools that offer more than just a one-dimensional resource.<\/p>\n<p>We&#8217;ll give you five ideas to get high-quality, creative stock images, photos, templates, mock-ups, and more. We&#8217;ve used all of these and still do.<\/p>\n\t\tTable of Contents\n\t\t\t\t\t\n<h2>\n\t\tCanva\n\t<\/h2>\n\t<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n<strong>Price:<\/strong> Free for the standard version<br \/>\n<strong>Pro: <\/strong>$119.99\/year or about $9.90\/month.\n<p>Canva is one of those stock image app resources that offers so much for the price. $119 per year may seem steep to many people, but when you consider everything it provides, Canva is a steal.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>Canva is a big-time steal.<\/strong><\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Why is Canva a steal? Well, think about what you get and how much easier Canva will make your life. Believe it or not, most people aren&#8217;t top-notch graphic designers. In the past, you would usually have to hire a graphic designer or learn Adobe Photoshop or Illustrator. With technology, however, you no longer need to do that.<\/p>\n<p>And that&#8217;s one of the special tools Canva provides, the ability to create custom and personalized designs without having to learn a tool like Photoshop.<\/p>\n<p>You can be a professional graphic designer (almost) with just a few clicks and drop and drags. Canva makes it easy with their pre-made templates, too. Just choose a template and customize it to make it your own.<\/p>\n<p>Canva offers so many helpful tools that we can&#8217;t describe them all here, but some of our favorites are:<\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Marketing templates<\/li>\n<li>Video templates<\/li>\n<li>Social media templates and pre-made designs<\/li>\n<li>Presentation templates<\/li>\n<li>Print marketing features<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.canva.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Visit Canva<\/a><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/canva-stock-tool.jpg\" alt=\"stock image resource\" itemprop=\"image\" height=\"350\" width=\"1280\" title=\"canva-stock-tool\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"  \/>\n<h2>\n\t\tFreepik\n\t<\/h2>\n\t<p><strong>Price:\u00a0<\/strong> $144\/year or $12\/month<\/p>\n<p>Freekpik is another tool we couldn&#8217;t live without. This resource is especially helpful if you do use Photoshop or Illustrator but aren&#8217;t quite an expert yet.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Why?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Frepik also offers templates, but not just any templates. They provide PSD templates to incorporate into your Photoshop files easily. This takes a lot of work out of your design process.<\/p>\n<p>In addition, Freepik also includes vector files, fonts, stock images and photos, 3D options, full designer collections, and more.<\/p>\n<p>What&#8217;s also nice is that their search bar is quite good. We&#8217;ve always had success finding exactly what we need when utilizing their search bar.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.freepik.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Visit Freepik<\/a><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/stock-template-mockup-demo.jpg\" alt=\"metricsmule graphic design with stock image resources\" itemprop=\"image\" height=\"720\" width=\"1280\" title=\"stock-template-mockup-demo\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"  \/>\n<h2>\n\t\tEnvato Elements\n\t<\/h2>\n\t<strong>Price: <\/strong>$16\/month<br \/>\n<strong>Free Trial:<\/strong> 7-days\n<p>Envato Elements offers a ton! For Envato&#8217;s price, it&#8217;s a great deal, considering everything you&#8217;ll have access to.<\/p>\n<p>And as a bonus, Envato Elements has a pretty good education section to help teach you how to use some of the most popular graphic design tools.<\/p>\n<p><strong>What you&#8217;ll get:\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stock video<\/li>\n<li>Video templates<\/li>\n<li>Music<\/li>\n<li>Sound effects<\/li>\n<li>Graphic templates<\/li>\n<li>Presentation templates<\/li>\n<li>Stock images and photos<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>The thing that&#8217;s great about this tool is that you&#8217;ll have access to a lot of other creators out there in the world that make many of the designs you&#8217;ll see.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/elements.envato.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Visit Envato Elements<\/a><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/2-gradient-phones.jpg\" alt=\"Metricsmule recommended stock image apps\" itemprop=\"image\" height=\"720\" width=\"1280\" title=\"2-gradient-phones\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"  \/>\n<h2>\n\t\tAdobe Stock\n\t<\/h2>\n\t<p><strong>Price: <\/strong>Starting at $29\/month and all the way up to $199\/month, depending on your needs.<\/p>\n<p>I must admit, this is one of the most expensive stock image\/video tools, but the quality is outstanding. When you download a stock image from Adobe Stock, rest-assured that it will be a high-quality image or video.<\/p>\n<p>Nothing is worse than downloading a stock image or photo only to realize that once you expand it or make it larger, it quickly gets pixelated. You won&#8217;t have that problem with Adobe Stock. Their quality is really good, and I&#8217;ve never had any issues with quality.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So what do you get for the starter pack for $29\/month?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Unfortunately, not as much as the other resources we mention. For the starter package, you&#8217;ll only get ten standard assets a month. Standard assets include standard images, templates, audio, and vector\/PSD files. And keep in mind that one download video will quickly eat up your allotted asset amount. For example, the last video I downloaded cost six assets.<\/p>\n<p>But an awesome thing I do like about Adobe Stock is that any unused credits will just continue to roll over into the next subsequent months. Right now, we have about 100 credits to use.<\/p>\n<p>In the past, you wouldn&#8217;t get much more than stock videos with Adobe Stock, but they&#8217;ve recently added more, which we love.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Get access to:\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Stock images, photos<\/li>\n<li>Stock videos<\/li>\n<li>PSD, vector files<\/li>\n<li>Illustrations<\/li>\n<li>Templates<\/li>\n<li>Video<\/li>\n<li>Audio (newer)<\/li>\n<li>Fonts<\/li>\n<li>Added plugins<\/li>\n<li>3D<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/stock.adobe.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Visit Adobe Stock<\/a><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/03\/SE0-think-big.jpg\" alt=\"SE0-think-big\" itemprop=\"image\" height=\"700\" width=\"700\" title=\"SE0-think-big\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"  \/>\n<h2>\n\t\tSoundstripe\n\t<\/h2>\n\t<p><strong>Price:\u00a0<\/strong>$9.99\/month or $19.99\/month for Pro<\/p>\n<p>Soundstripe is fantastic for finding music, sound effects, and curated playlists. They&#8217;ve also recently added even more tools, which I&#8217;ll list below.<\/p>\n<p>Yes, you can find stock audio at other places, but I like Soundstripe because they make it extremely simple to find what you need. I love how you can filter the type of music or SFX you want.<\/p>\n<p>You can search and filter by genre, characteristic, mood, speed, and more. And their music isn&#8217;t the same redundant, cheesy music many stock audio sites provide. These tracks are high-quality produced and make me want to jam out to them in my car.<\/p>\n<blockquote><p>What&#8217;s also cool and new is their new Soundstripe app.<\/p><\/blockquote>\n<p>Sometimes I don&#8217;t want to break out my laptop or hop on my work computer to find what I need. The Soundstream App is helpful when you&#8217;re just lounging on the couch and want to scroll through some music to use on your next piece of content. This saves a lot of time. I can easily find some really good songs in just a few minutes simply by using their app and filtering a few options to download what I need.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Soundstripe Projects<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Soundstripe recently rolled out &#8220;Projects,&#8221; which is pretty cool. With &#8220;Projects,&#8221; you can stay organized and have your own media hub where you can store your files, share and collaborate, and revisit your project history.<\/p>\n<p>Soundstripe is one of our favorites for audio and well worth the price.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.soundstripe.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Visit Soundstripe<\/a><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/soundstripe-stock.jpg\" alt=\"metricsmule recommended stock audio soundstripe\" itemprop=\"image\" height=\"720\" width=\"1280\" title=\"soundstripe-stock\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"  \/>\n<h2>\n\t\tBonus: Flaticon\n\t<\/h2>\n\t<p>I had to add this app, Flaticon in here as a bonus because it&#8217;s just too good to pass up and it has saved me so much time.<\/p>\n<p>A lot of time.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Price: <\/strong>$8.25\/month<\/p>\n<p>The reason why I had Flaticon here as a bonus is because it&#8217;s actually tied to our first recommendation, FreePik. You can combine your subscriptions with FreePik and Flaticon to get a better deal.<\/p>\n<p><strong>So what exactly is Flaticon?<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Flaticon&#8217;s focus is icons and stickers. I love it when an app focuses really well on just a few things, and Flaticon does just that. I like to combine my subscription to utilize both FreePik and Flaticon together.<\/p>\n<p><strong>Here are a few items I use Flaticon for:\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<ul>\n<li>Variety of icons<\/li>\n<li>Icon variations, like bold or regular styles<\/li>\n<li>Interface icons<\/li>\n<li>Animated icons, downloadable as a gif or video file<\/li>\n<li>Stickers<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n<p>Oh, and one more thing I love about this tool. While you&#8217;re downloading the icon you need, you can actually edit and change the colors on the fly. For example, if you download a red cloud icon, you can instantly change it to purple before quickly downloading it.<\/p>\n<p><a href=\"https:\/\/www.flaticon.com\" rel=\"nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Visit Flaticon<\/a><\/p>\n\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2022\/11\/icons-flaticon.jpg\" alt=\"metricsmule recommended stock icon tool\" itemprop=\"image\" height=\"350\" width=\"1280\" title=\"icons-flaticon\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"  \/>\n<h2>\n\t\tSummary\n\t<\/h2>\n\t<p>These apps should supply you with a good, affordable start. Even if you choose one or two of these stock image and video tools you&#8217;ll be able to find almost everything you need. And if you discover that you prefer one more than the other, they make it easy for you to cancel.<\/p>\n<p>I love apps like these, probably too much. I&#8217;ve had to cut back recently because I just had too many comparable stock apps. But every now and then I&#8217;ll switch things out just for a new look and feel.<\/p>\n<p>There are a lot of good, quality stock resources out there and we use many others. We&#8217;ll create another post down the road to discuss a few more. But for now, I think you&#8217;ll really enjoy these.<\/p>\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>UABB Share Button &#8211; Click here to edit the &quot;Floating Share Button&quot; settings.
