Let&#8217;s go!\u00a0<\/p>\n\t<p>Airtable is a relational database that does it all. It can be used to organize anything you want and makes filtering and searching as easy as one click. Airtable has a drag-and-drop interface when used as a Kanban view (comparable to Trello) and makes content creation easier than ever.<\/p>\n<p>Another major advantage of Airtable is its integration with other tools and platforms. Users can connect Airtable to popular apps like Slack, Gmail, and Trello, and can use Zapier or Integromat to automate workflows and streamline data management. This makes it easy to use Airtable as a central hub for all of your business data and processes, and ensures that you can access and manipulate your data in the ways that work best for you.<\/p>\n<p>Even more awesome is that Airtable is highly customizable. Users can choose from a variety of templates to get started with common use cases like project management, CRM, stocks tracking, financials management, and content creation.\u00a0 This flexibility allows users to adapt Airtable to their specific workflows and processes and ensures that the platform can grow and evolve alongside their businesses.<\/p>\n\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\tAirtable Tutorial Examples\n\t\t<\/h2>\n\t\t\t<p>On my website (this one), MetricsMule.com, you&#8217;ll notice I have both a BLOG and a VLOG page.\u00a0But why? Why have both? Isn&#8217;t that redundant?<br \/>The short answer: No, it&#8217;s not. And here&#8217;s why.A blog page contains every bit of news, updates, articles, and posts &#8211; regardless of whether the post contains a video (or not). It&#8217;s the main place readers can receive the information they want. Think of it as the main street with all the shops and restaurants.\u00a0The VLOG page, however, serves one purpose: To contain all blog posts that contain a video. Now, why is this important? It&#8217;s important because many people may search for relevant information via video only. They may be visual learners and would prefer to watch a video rather than read a long-form piece of text. That&#8217;s where the VLOG page comes in. Once you visit the VLOG page, you&#8217;ll be able to see every post that contains a video. What I mean is that you&#8217;ll only see posts on the VLOG page that contain the &#8220;VIDEO&#8221; tag; hence the posts contain an embedded YouTube video.\u00a0<strong>So, where does Airtable come in?<\/strong>Airtable makes it extremely easy to track every post you&#8217;ve written and link them to your YouTube page and your VLOG page. Simply put, it helps you stay as organized as possible. And organization leads to productivity. And productivity leads to profitability.\u00a0Make sure you watch <strong><a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=FdbpkICzQsE&amp;t=1151s\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">this Airtable Tutorial,<\/a><\/strong> so this makes sense.\u00a0<em><strong>Example:\u00a0<\/strong><\/em>Let&#8217;s say you film a video entitled &#8220;<a href=\"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/airtable\/\">Airtable Consulting Expert.<\/a>&#8221; After you film that video, you add it to your YouTube page. Once you upload your Airtable video to YouTube, you want to add it to your website now.\u00a0 Here are the steps&#8230;\u00a0<ol><li>Copy the YouTube video&#8217;s URL<\/li><li>Write a blog post on your website relating to the same video you just filmed about <a href=\"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/airtable\/\">Airtable Consulting<\/a>\u00a0<\/li><li>Tag that blog post with your own tag of choice. I use the tag &#8220;video&#8221;<\/li><li>On your Vlog page, you&#8217;ll need to make sure that only blog posts with the &#8220;video&#8221; tag will appear on that page<\/li><\/ol><blockquote><strong>How do you perform step #4?<br \/><\/strong><\/blockquote>Using the WordPress Post module, make sure in the Query, you chose the option only to show posts containing a specific tag. In the box, type your tag. In this case, it would be &#8220;video&#8221; Once you do that, you&#8217;re done.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\t\t\n\t\t\t\t<img decoding=\"async\" src=\"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2023\/03\/Airtable-Consulting.jpg\" alt=\"Airtable online consulting experts\" itemprop=\"image\" height=\"720\" width=\"1280\" title=\"Airtable-Consulting\" onerror=\"this.style.display='none'\"  \/>\n\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\tAirtable for SEO\n\t\t<\/h2>\n\t\t\t<p>Airtable can be a useful tool for SEO (search engine optimization) by helping you organize and track your SEO efforts in a centralized and customizable way. When used with other SEO tools like SEMRush, Ahrefs and vidIQ, your productivity will level up big time. Here are some ways you can use Airtable for SEO:<ol><li><strong>Keyword research:<\/strong> Use Airtable to create a table of keywords related to your business or industry. These can include your focus keywords, secondary keywords, and longtail keywords. Anothother helpful option is to create a column that includes &#8220;people also ask&#8221; searches. In addition, you can have columns for search volume, competition, and other metrics to help you prioritize and target the most valuable keywords.<\/li><li><strong>Content planning:<\/strong> Create a table for your content calendar, with columns for topics, keywords, target audience, publishing dates, and other relevant details. You can also use Airtable to collaborate with your team on content ideas and track the progress of each piece of content. In my video above, you&#8217;ll see how I link it all together: blog posts, vlogs, and YouTube videos. Combine that with your chosen keywords and you&#8217;ll be off to the productivity races.\u00a0<\/li><li><strong>Link building:<\/strong> Use Airtable to keep track of your link-building efforts, including outreach emails, target websites, response rates, and links acquired. This can help you identify opportunities for improvement and measure the effectiveness of your link-building campaigns. In my massive Airtable SEO checklist, I keep track of every backlink I have for this website.\u00a0<\/li><li><strong>Technical SEO:<\/strong> Create a table to track technical SEO issues on your website, such as broken links, missing meta tags, and slow page speed. You can also use Airtable to collaborate with your web development team on fixing these issues. In my video above, you can see how I include my title tags, H1s, and H2s, and link them together in a cohesive Airtable base.\u00a0<\/li><li><strong>Reporting:<\/strong> Use Airtable to create customized reports on your SEO performance, including metrics such as organic traffic, keyword rankings, and backlink profile. You can also use Airtable to track the progress of your SEO goals and identify areas for improvement. What I find extremely useful is the ability to download SEO and keyword research reports from tools like SEMRush and instantly import them into Airtable using their CSV import extension.\u00a0<\/li><\/ol><\/p>\t\t\n\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\tSchedule a Call\n\t\t<\/h2>\n\t\t\t<p>Scheule a Free Airtable Tutorial Call<\/p>\t\t\n\t<!-- Calendly inline widget begin -->\n<!-- Calendly inline widget end -->\n\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\tAirtable Consulting\n\t\t<\/h2>\n\t\t\t<p>Boost your productivity BIG time with <a href=\"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/airtable\/\">online Airtable Consulting<\/a> packages.
