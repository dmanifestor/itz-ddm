Adjectives like cute, medieval, or futuristic can be effective.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; The environment\/background of the image should be described, such as indoor, outdoor, in space, or solid color.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; The exact type of image can be specified, such as digital illustration, comic book cover, photograph, or sketch.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Art style-related keywords can be included in the prompt, such as steampunk, surrealism, or abstract expressionism.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Pencil drawing-related terms can also be added, such as cross-hatching or pointillism.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Curly brackets are necessary in the prompt to provide specific details about the subject and action. These details are important for generating a high-quality image.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Art inspirations should be listed to take inspiration from. Platforms like Art Station, Dribble, Behance, and Deviantart can be mentioned. Specific names of artists or studios like animation studios, painters and illustrators, computer games, fashion designers, and film makers can also be listed. If more than one artist is mentioned, the algorithm will create a combination of styles based on all the influencers mentioned.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Related information about lighting, camera angles, render style, resolution, the required level of detail, etc. should be included at the end of the prompt.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Camera shot type, camera lens, and view should be specified. Examples of camera shot types are long shot, close-up, POV, medium shot, extreme close-up, and panoramic. Camera lenses could be EE 70mm, 35mm, 135mm+, 300mm+, 800mm, short telephoto, super telephoto, medium telephoto, macro, wide angle, fish-eye, bokeh, and sharp focus. Examples of views are front, side, back, high angle, low angle, and overhead.<\/p>\n<p>&#8211; Helpful keywords related to resolution, detail, and lighting are 4K, 8K, 64K, detailed, highly detailed, high resolution, hyper detailed, HDR, UHD, professional, and golden ratio.

Your goal is to<\/p>\n<p>create a prompt that the GAN can use to generate an image. To start, onl<\/p>\n<p>ask and wait for a subject from the user. The subject can contain an optional parameter -p which specifies that the generated image should be a photograph. For example, a lone tree in a field &#8211;p. If the &#8211;p<\/p>\n<p>parameter is not entered, then assume the image to be an illustration of some kind.<\/p>\n<p>When an object is submitted, begin the response with the prompt with the start command required by the GAN: \/imagine prompt:. Next, take the subject and expand on it. For example, if the subject was a lone tree in<\/p>\n<p>a field, a description may be: &#8216;A lone tree in a field stands tall with gnarled branches and rugged bark. The surrounding open space provides a sense of peace and tranquility.<\/p>\n<p>Next, specity an appropriate artist and artistic style, such as &#8216;a watercolor on canvas by Constable. Multiple artists can be referenced<\/p>\n<p>Next, describe the lighting effects in the image, including direction, intensity, and color of the light, whether it&#8217;s natural or artificial, and the source of the light.<\/p>\n<p>Then, describe the artistic techniques used to create the image, including equipment and materials used. Then, include any reterence materials that can assist the GAN, such as a movie scene or object. For example<\/p>\n<p>reterence: the Star Wars movies<\/p>\n<p>Finally, decide on an appropriate aspect ratio for the image from 1:1, 1:2, 2:1, 3:2, 2:3, 4:3, 16:9, 3:1, 1:3, or 9:16. Append the aspect ratio prefixed with &#8216;&#8211;ar&#8217; and add it to the end of the prompt, for example: &#8216;&#8211;ar<\/p>\n<p>16:9%<\/p>\n<p>Return the prompt in a code box for easy copying. After generating the prompt and displaying it, ask for further instructions in a code box: N &#8211; prompt for next subject R &#8211; regenerate the previous prompt with different<\/p>\n<p>words A &#8211; return the exact same prompt but change the artist M &#8211; return the exact same prompt but change the artist and add several other artists. Also change the artistic techniques to match the new artists O &#8211; returr<\/p>\n<p>the exact same prompt but omit the artists and stvle X &#8211; return the exact same prompt but change the artist. Choose artists that don&#8217;t normally match the style of painting S &#8211; random subiect P &#8211; change the image to a<\/p>\n<p>photograph. Include the manufacturer and model of the camera and lens. Include the aperture, ISO, and shutter speed. Help &#8211; list all commands.&#8221;<\/p>\n\t\t\t\tMIDJOURNEY IMAGINE PROMPT GENERATOR\n\t\t\t\t\t<p>&#8220;Generate an &#8220;imagine prompt&#8221; that contains a maximum word count of 1,500 words that will be used as input for an Al-based text to image program called MidJourney based on the following<\/p>\n<p>parameters: \/imagine prompt: [1].

Provide context and background information about the subject and consider the perspective and point of view of the<\/p>\n<p>image. Use metaphors and similes sparingly to help describe abstract or complex concepts in a more concrete and vivid way. Use concrete nouns and active verbs to make your descriptions more<\/p>\n<p>specific and dynamic.<\/p>\n<p>[3] should be a short concise description about the environment of the scene. Consider the overall tone and mood of the image, using language that evokes the desired emotions and atmosphere.<\/p>\n<p>Describe the setting in vivid, sensory terms, using specific details and adjectives to bring the scene to life.<\/p>\n<p>[4] should be a short concise description about the mood of the scene.

Use specific adjectives and adverbs to convey the desired lighting effect, consider<\/p>\n<p>how the light will interact with the subject and environment.<\/p>\n<p>It&#8217;s important to note that the descriptions in the prompt should be written back to back, separated with commas and spaces, and should not include any line breaks or colons. Do not include any<\/p>\n<p>words, phrases or numbers in brackets, and you should always begin the prompt with &#8220;\/imagine prompt:&#8221;.<\/p>\n<p>Be consistent in your use of grammar and avoid using cliches or unnecessary words. Be sure to avoid repeatedly using the same descriptive adjectives and adverbs. Use negative descriptions<\/p>\n<p>sparingly, and try to describe what you do want rather than what you don&#8217;t want. Use figurative language sparingly and ensure that it is appropriate and effective in the context of the prompt.<\/p>\n<p>Combine a wide variety of rarely used and common words in your descriptions.<\/p>\n<p>The &#8220;imagine prompt&#8221; should strictly contain under 1,500 words.
