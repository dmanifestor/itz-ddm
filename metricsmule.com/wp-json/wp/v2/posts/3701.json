Let&#8217;s go!\u00a0<\/p>\n\t<p>ChatGPT is the rave right now. From writing blog posts, ebooks, or coding, ChatGPT does a good job handling these tasks.<\/p>\n<p>I decided to try it for SEO, and it did a good job.<\/p>\n<p>I first asked ChatGPT to provide me with ten high-volume keywords with a low competition score related to automotive repair and plumbing. Chat GPT got the keywords right regarding the volume, but it failed to provide low-competition keywords. This was expected because other tools specialize in doing this, like SemRush or Ahrefs. After all, I used SemRush to validate ChatGPT&#8217;s provided keywords.<\/p>\n\t\tTable of Contents\n\t\t\t\t\t\n<h2>\n\t\tShow me an SEO audit checklist\n\t<\/h2>\n\t<p><strong>Here&#8217;s what ChatGPT produced:\u00a0<\/strong><\/p>\n<p>Here is a basic SEO audit checklist:<\/p>\n1. Check the website&#8217;s accessibility and crawlability:<br \/>\n&#8211; Can search engines access and crawl the website?<br \/>\n&#8211; Are there any broken links or error pages?<br \/>\n&#8211; Is the website mobile-friendly and responsive?\n2. Check the website&#8217;s content and structure:<br \/>\n&#8211; Is the content of the website relevant, informative, and useful?<br \/>\n&#8211; Is the content organized in a logical and easy-to-follow structure?<br \/>\n&#8211; Are the headings, subheadings, and other tags being used appropriately?<br \/>\n&#8211; Is the website using appropriate keywords in the content and meta tags?\n3. Check the website&#8217;s performance and speed:<br \/>\n&#8211; Is the website loading quickly enough?<br \/>\n&#8211; Are there any issues with the website&#8217;s code or the server that could be causing slow<br \/>\nperformance?\n4. Check the website&#8217;s technical SEO:<br \/>\n&#8211; Is the website properly indexed by search engines?<br \/>\n&#8211; Are there any duplicate content issues on the website?<br \/>\n&#8211; Are the website&#8217;s URLs and permalinks structured appropriately?<br \/>\n&#8211; Is the website using canonicals and ahrefs tags correctly?\n<p>5.

Here&#8217;s how to do it:<br \/>\n1. Go to https:\/\/analytics.google.com\/ and click &#8220;Sign In&#8221; in the top right corner.<br \/>\n2. Sign in with your Google account or create a new one.<br \/>\n3. Click &#8220;Admin&#8221; in the bottom left corner.<br \/>\n4. In the column on the right, click &#8220;Tracking Info&#8221; and then click &#8220;Tracking Code&#8221;<br \/>\n5.<br \/>\nThe tracking code will be displayed on the page. It should look something like this:\n<blockquote>Copy the tracking code and paste it into the HTML of your website, just before the closing<br \/>\n&#8220;&lt;\/head&gt;<br \/>\n^ tag. Be sure to replace &#8220;GA_TRACKING_ID&#8221; with your actual<br \/>\ntracking ID.<\/blockquote>\nThat&#8217;s it! Google Analytics will now track visits to your website.

I was impressed with the accuracy, speed, and ability to generate most questions I asked it. However, I must stress that when it comes to SEO I wouldn&#8217;t completely rely on it, especially for generating blog posts.\u00a0<strong>Why blog posts?<br \/><\/strong><br \/>Blog posts are supposed to have character with your own personal touch. Generated AI content is not that. Although professional and accurate, I feel like it lacks the human touch (except for the catchy email subject lines or generated funny emails &#8211; those were great).\u00a0And when it comes to Google and SEO it can be a great tool to use as a starting point or act as a crutch for when\/if you develop a brain fog and need some new, fresh ideas. I wouldn&#8217;t use it solely as my #1 dependant though. Google likes &#8220;helpful content&#8221;, thus their recent update entitled just that: Helpful Content Update. Search engines like content that is unique, helpful, and relevant to the user&#8217;s search intent, and something tells me that Google (if not now, soon) will be able to sniff out more and more AI-generated content as it continues to soar in popularity. In fact, ChatGPT is getting so popular (while in Beta) that I&#8217;m continuously getting an update from them that they&#8217;re overloaded. So, the secret is out of the bag.\u00a0<\/p>\t\t\n\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>How to use ChatGPT for SEO I tried ChatGPT for SEO and WOW, impressive!\u00a0 Check out this ChatGPT demo video &hellip;<\/p>\n<p class=\"read-more\"> <a class=\"\" href=\"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/seo-google\/chatgpt-for-seo\/\"> <span class=\"screen-reader-text\">How to use ChatGPT for SEO<\/span> Read More<\/a><\/p>\n","protected":false},"author":2,"featured_media":3702,"comment_status":"open","ping_status":"open","sticky":false,"template":"","format":"standard","meta":{"site-sidebar-layout":"default","site-content-layout":"plain-container","ast-site-content-layout":"","site-content-style":"default","site-sidebar-style":"default","ast-global-header-display":"","ast-banner-title-visibility":"","ast-main-header-display":"","ast-hfb-above-header-display":"","ast-hfb-below-header-display":"","ast-hfb-mobile-header-display":"","site-post-title":"disabled","ast-breadcrumbs-content":"","ast-featured-img":"disabled","footer-sml-layout":"","theme-transparent-header-meta":"","adv-header-id-meta":"","stick-header-meta":"","header-above-stick-meta":"","header-main-stick-meta":"","header-below-stick-meta":"","astra-migrate-meta-layouts":"","ast-page-background-enabled":"default","ast-page-background-meta":{"desktop":{"background-color":"","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-gradient":""},"tablet":{"background-color":"","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-gradient":""},"mobile":{"background-color":"","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-gradient":""}},"ast-content-background-meta":{"desktop":{"background-color":"var(--ast-global-color-5)","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-gradient":""},"tablet":{"background-color":"var(--ast-global-color-5)","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-gradient":""},"mobile":{"background-color":"var(--ast-global-color-5)","background-image":"","background-repeat":"repeat","background-position":"center center","background-size":"auto","background-attachment":"scroll","background-type":"","background-media":"","overlay-type":"","overlay-color":"","overlay-gradient":""}},"footnotes":""},"categories":[32],"tags":[59],"_links":{"self":[{"href":"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3701"}],"collection":[{"href":"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts"}],"about":[{"href":"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/types\/post"}],"author":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/users\/2"}],"replies":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/comments?post=3701"}],"version-history":[{"count":0,"href":"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/posts\/3701\/revisions"}],"wp:featuredmedia":[{"embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media\/3702"}],"wp:attachment":[{"href":"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/media?parent=3701"}],"wp:term":[{"taxonomy":"category","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/categories?post=3701"},{"taxonomy":"post_tag","embeddable":true,"href":"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/wp-json\/wp\/v2\/tags?post=3701"}],"curies":[{"name":"wp","href":"https:\/\/api.w.org\/{rel}","templated":true}]}}
