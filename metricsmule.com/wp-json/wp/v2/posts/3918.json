[3] = with a detailed description describing the environment of the scene. [4] = with a detailed description describing the mood\/feelings and atmosphere of the scene. [5] = A style, for example: photography, painting, illustration, sculpture, Artwork, paperwork, 3d and more). [6] = A description of how [5] will be realized. (e.g. Photography (e.g. Macro, Fisheye Style, Portrait) with camera model and appropriate camera settings, Painting with detailed descriptions about the materials and working material used, rendering with engine settings, a digital Illustration, a woodburn art (and everything else that could be defined as an output type) [7] = Parameters detaills as given below Note don&#8217;t use , when using parameter options and use all important parameter options which is required to generate image. Parameters details start Aspect Ratios (&#8211;aspect or &#8211;ar): Changes the aspect ratio of a generation. &#8211;aspect 5:4: Common frame and print ratio. &#8211;aspect 4:3: Common in television and photography. &#8211;aspect 3:2: Common in print photography. &#8211;aspect 16:9: Common in widescreen television and video. &#8211;aspect 2:1: Common in panoramic photography. &#8211;aspect 7:4: Close to HD TV screens and smartphone screens. &#8211;aspect 9:16: Common in vertical videos and smartphone screens. &#8211;aspect 1:2: Common in portrait-oriented photography. Chaos (&#8211;chaos &lt;number&gt;): Changes how varied the results will be. Higher values produce more unusual and unexpected generations. chaos parameter accepts a number from 0 to 100, where 0 produces very similar and expected results and 100 produces highly varied and unexpected results Negative prompting (&#8211;no): Removes unwanted elements from the image. Quality (&#8211;quality or &#8211;q &lt;.25, .5, 1, or 2&gt;): Controls the rendering quality of the image. Default is 1. Seed (&#8211;seed &lt;integer between 0-4294967295&gt;): Specifies a seed number to generate the initial image grids. Using the same seed number and prompt will produce similar ending images. Stop (&#8211;stop &lt;integer between 10-100&gt;): Finishes a job partway through the process. Stopping a job at an earlier percentage can create blurrier, less detailed results. Model Version (&#8211;version or &#8211;v &lt;1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 5.1&gt;): Uses a different version of the Midjourney algorithm. The current algorithm (V5.1) is the default setting. Stylize (&#8211;stylize &lt;number&gt; or &#8211;s &lt;number&gt;): Influences how strongly Midjourney&#8217;s default aesthetic style is applied to jobs. This parameter accepts a number from 0 to 1000, where 0 produces images that more closely resemble the input prompt and 1000 produces images with the strongest default Midjourney aesthetic style Upscalers (&#8211;uplight, &#8211;upbeta, &#8211;upanime): Adds additional details to the low-resolution image grid. Multiple upscale models are available. Image Weight (&#8211;iw): Sets the image prompt weight relative to text weight. Default value is 0.25. Parameters details End* Use aspect ratio which fits best for the image as per your understading. If [5] looks best in a Japanese art style use, &#8220;&#8221;&#8211;niji 5&#8243;&#8221;.

To be honest both are good, but I do think they both have their pros and cons. When comparing any AI art generating app, I think it&#8217;s important to consider two main categories; ease of use and quality of images. Below, I&#8217;ll break down my opinion and show a side-by-side comparison with image examples.\u00a0<\/p>\t\t\n\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\tEase of use.\n\t\t<\/h2>\n\t\t\t<p><strong>What&#8217;s easier to use between Adobe Firefly and Midjourney?<\/strong><strong>Adobe Firefly:\u00a0<\/strong>Access the AI generator and create beautiful looking AI art directly within the Firefly app (webpage) itself. If you&#8217;re just starting out or new to this AI art generating world, then Adobe Firefly may be easier for you to use.<br \/><br \/><strong>Why?\u00a0<\/strong>Unlike Midjourney, Firefly provides you with a lot of great looking examples and ready-to-use prompt descriptions to work off of. It&#8217;s not as good as Leonardo AI, but it provides the user with a good visual for starting out.\u00a0<strong>Midjourney:\u00a0<\/strong>In order to use Midjourney you&#8217;ll need to have a Discord account (no big deal) and generate all of your art directly within Discord itself. The only visual examples you&#8217;ll have access to are other user&#8217;s artwork that they&#8217;re generating at the same time as you. These are usually awesome and very impressive to look at. But when using Midjourney, you&#8217;ll need to know exactly what you&#8217;re looking for and wanting to craft. There really isn&#8217;t any visual stepping stones to help you figure out what you&#8217;re looking for (visually at least). In Firefly, you have the ability to choose from a wide arrange of content type categories like: vivid, cyberpunk, colorful, art, concept, photo, etc. In Midjourney, you&#8217;ll have to actually type this into your prompt.\u00a0<strong>Winner:<\/strong> Adobe Firefly<\/p>\t\t\n\t\t\t<a href=\"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\/downloads\/awesome-chatgpt-prompts\/\" target=\"_self\" rel=\"noopener\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t1000+ Prompts PRO\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\tGet Access to Premium Prompts\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t<link itemprop=\"url\" href=\"https:\/\/metricsmule.com\"\/>\n\t\t<a itemprop=\"sameAs\" href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/@metricsmule\/?sub_confirmation=1\" target=\"_blank\" title=\"YouTube\" aria-label=\"YouTube\" role=\"button\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer external\">\n\t\t\t\t\t<\/a>\n\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\t1300+ ChatGPT PRO Prompts\n\t\t<\/h2>\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Get access to the best ChatGPT Prompts&#8230;<br \/>These aren&#8217;t the average prompts you&#8217;ll find elsewhere.
