Who likes getting told &#8220;NO&#8221; all the time or having doors continuously slammed in their face? Not me.\u00a0<br \/>But I did it for years. And years. And years. So many years, in fact, that I was able to learn the hard way. But luckily, I was able to learn from all of my mistakes and misfortunes and I&#8217;m sharing them (what worked) with you.\u00a0<em>But, make sure you watch the video above &#8211; that&#8217;s the biggest takeaway.\u00a0<\/em><\/p>\t\t\n\t\tTable of Contents\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\tPractical Marketing Tip #1\n\t\t<\/h2>\n\t\t\t<p><strong>Be an advisor and &#8220;not just a vendor&#8221;<\/strong>Too many marketers get caught up in price wars, phone call tagging games, and constant appeasing, leading to desperation.\u00a0Don&#8217;t do that.\u00a0Here&#8217;s what you do (but it takes patience and discipline).\u00a0Become more of a trusted advisor, rather than a vendor, or someone that customers just view as &#8220;someone they use.&#8221;\u00a0<em><strong>How?<\/strong><\/em>Start by making your website become a knowledge hub. Don&#8217;t have your website be all about you, how awesome you are, how great your services are, etc.\u00a0No.\u00a0Make it a place your customers want to visit to learn more industry-related knowledge.\u00a0<strong>For example:\u00a0<\/strong><br \/>The company I previously owned was an e-commerce website. We sold a very niche automotive part. A customer&#8217;s prime focus on our website (before I implemented this marketing strategy) was solely to purchase a part they needed.\u00a0But I changed that.\u00a0I redesigned my website to now include a BLOG page and a VLOG page. And it worked, magically. My website now became a place people (prospects) would visit and depend on to read the most recent news in the automotive industry.\u00a0So even though they weren&#8217;t buying a part today. That&#8217;s okay.\u00a0Because when they did need one, who do you think they remembered?\u00a0Yup, ours.\u00a0Because they became familiar with my website and frequented it more often to read automotive industry-related news, they remembered us.\u00a0\u00a0<\/p>\t\t\n<h3>\n\t\tWant a free website audit?\n\t<\/h3>\n\t<p>Start your explosive growth journey.<\/p>\n\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\tPractical Marketing Tip #2\n\t\t<\/h2>\n\t\t\t<p><b>A piece of helpful advice (from past experiences): Make it about them (not you).\u00a0<\/b>The following examples are real&#8230;<br \/>These are real emails I get frequently where the sender attempts to relate to me (their prospect) by telling me about themselves, their product, or their &#8220;wants&#8221;.\u00a0<ol><li>&#8220;We&#8217;ve formed a strategic partnership with (some company) and it made us the premier&#8230;blah blah blah&#8221;<em>Ok, cool.

Not like everybody else.\u00a0<\/b>For this piece of advice, I recommend watching the video above to see what I mean.\u00a0But just be a little different than everyone else. For example, picture yourself at an after-conference cocktail party.\u00a0In your head, can you imagine how most people will approach their dream prospects? Chances are, it&#8217;s probably very similar to everyone else.\u00a0Check the video to see some simple, yet effective marketing advice that helped me close a million-dollar deal with one of the largest insurance companies in the U.S.<\/p>\t\t\n\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\tSchedule a free 30-min discovery call.\n\t\t<\/h2>\n\t\t\t<p>Need SEO help?<\/p>\t\t\n\t<!-- Calendly inline widget begin -->\n<!-- Calendly inline widget end -->\n\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\tPractical Marketing Tip #4\n\t\t<\/h2>\n\t\t\t<p><b>Improve your e-mails.\u00a0<\/b>Instead of using the same things everyone else does, be different to stand out.\u00a0For example, most people send newsletters, email marketing campaigns, etc., using robust CRMs. This is fine and often justified and valuable.\u00a0However, if it&#8217;s a person who has yet to sign up for your marketing collateral or you don&#8217;t know them too well, this runs the risk of them hitting that good ole unsubscribe button.\u00a0I mean, that&#8217;s okay. It happens. But you want to avoid being known as a spammer, so it&#8217;s best to limit this.\u00a0<strong>What to do instead&#8230;<\/strong>Use a GIF file in your emails.\u00a0That way you still capture the attention of the receiver but you&#8217;re also limiting the chance of your email getting blocked into spam mail because of high amounts of images and design features.\u00a0<\/p>\t\t\n\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\tPractical Marketing Tip #4.5\n\t\t<\/h2>\n\t\t\t<p><b>Give first. Receive later.\u00a0<\/b>I&#8217;m making this (4.5) instead of # 5 because it kind of ties into what was mentioned earlier, but this piece of advice works wonders.\u00a0It takes patience and discipline, but the ROI is awesome.\u00a0For this one, I also recommend watching the video above to see what I mean.\u00a0But to summarize&#8230;Make sure you&#8217;ve provided value to your prospects first before even thinking about asking them for something (to use you, purchase your product, etc.).\u00a0Far too many times I&#8217;ve seen people quickly jump to their prospective customers and just bluntly ask them if they can work together, be their chosen vendor, or buy something from their website.\u00a0Why should they?Don&#8217;t really know you (yet) so how can they trust that what they&#8217;ll receive on their end is worth their while and investment?\u00a0<\/p>\t\t\n\t\t<h2>\n\t\t\tSubscribe to our blog\n\t\t<\/h2>\n\t\t\t<p>For updates and free personalized tips.\u00a0<\/p>\t\t\n<form>\n\t<input type=\"hidden\" name=\"fl-layout-id\" value=\"3822\" \/>\n    \t\t<label for=\"pp-name-\">Name<\/label>\n    \t\tPlease enter your name.\n    \t\t<input type=\"text\" name=\"pp-name\" id=\"pp-name-\" value=\"\" placeholder=\"Name\"  \/>\n    \t\t<label for=\"pp-email-\">Email<\/label>\n    \t\tPlease enter a valid email address.\n    \t\t<input type=\"email\" name=\"pp-email\" id=\"pp-email-\" value=\"\" placeholder=\"Email\"  \/>\n    \t\t<label for=\"pp-message-\">Message<\/label>\n    \t\tPlease type your message.\n    \t\t<textarea name=\"pp-message\" id=\"pp-message-\" placeholder=\"Message\"><\/textarea>\n    \t<a href=\"#\" target=\"_self\" role=\"button\" rel=\"noopener\">\n    \t\t    \t\t    \t\tSend now\n    \t\t    \t<\/a>\n\t\t\tMessage failed.
