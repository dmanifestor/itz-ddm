Big time.\u00a0The magic eraser was released with Canva Magic Edit, and with the eraser, you can now remove any part of a photo you want. For example, in the video above (click to watch), I was able to completely remove myself from a photo I took at Joshua Tree.\u00a0When I asked Canva Magic Write what Canva Magic Eraser was, here&#8217;s what it said:<blockquote>Canva&#8217;s Magic Eraser tool is a feature that allows users to remove backgrounds from images with just one click. It uses AI technology to detect the subject of the image and automatically removes the background, making it easy to create professional-looking designs without the need for complex editing software.<\/blockquote><\/p>\t\t\n\t<a href=\"https:\/\/partner.canva.com\/0ZQVjY\" target=\"_blank\" role=\"button\" rel=\"noopener nofollow\" aria-label=\"Try Canva Pro.

But the coolest thing about Canva Magic Edit is that you can replace an item in a photo with something else.\u00a0<br \/>For example, in my photo, I&#8217;m standing at Joshua tree, a mountainous, rocky region in the desert. But what if I wanted to change my location to something with more of a resort-type view?\u00a0<strong>Simple.\u00a0<\/strong>All you have to do is:\u00a0<ol><li>Highlight the area you want to remove.<\/li><li>Once highlighted, let go.\u00a0<\/li><li>The Canva Eraser will go to work<\/li><li>But <em><strong>first<\/strong><\/em>&#8230;in the AI-Generator search bar, tell Canva exactly what you want your highlighted area to be replaced with (in my video, I told Canva to replace the rocky region with an island beach).\u00a0<\/li><li>Canva goes to work and instantly erases and replaces<\/li><li>It&#8217;s all done with Canva&#8217;s Magic AI<\/li><\/ol>Here&#8217;s an example of Canva&#8217;s Magic Writer (AI).
