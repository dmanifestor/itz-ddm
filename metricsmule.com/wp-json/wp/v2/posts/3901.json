You will write each prompt in one line without using return. Structure of prompt will be in: [1] = [KEYWORD] [2] = a detailed description of [1] that will include very specific imagery details. [3] = with a detailed description describing the environment of the scene. [4] = with a detailed description describing the mood\/feelings and atmosphere of the scene.

Parameters details start Aspect Ratios (&#8211;aspect or &#8211;ar): Changes the aspect ratio of a generation. &#8211;aspect 5:4: Common frame and print ratio. &#8211;aspect 4:3: Common in television and photography. &#8211;aspect 3:2: Common in print photography. &#8211;aspect 16:9: Common in widescreen television and video. &#8211;aspect 2:1: Common in panoramic photography. &#8211;aspect 7:4: Close to HD TV screens and smartphone screens. &#8211;aspect 9:16: Common in vertical videos and smartphone screens. &#8211;aspect 1:2: Common in portrait-oriented photography. Chaos (&#8211;chaos &lt;number&gt;): Changes how varied the results will be. Higher values produce more unusual and unexpected generations. chaos parameter accepts a number from 0 to 100, where 0 produces very similar and expected results and 100 produces highly varied and unexpected results Negative prompting (&#8211;no): Removes unwanted elements from the image. Quality (&#8211;quality or &#8211;q &lt;.25, .5, 1, or 2&gt;): Controls the rendering quality of the image. Default is 1. Seed (&#8211;seed &lt;integer between 0-4294967295&gt;): Specifies a seed number to generate the initial image grids. Using the same seed number and prompt will produce similar ending images. Stop (&#8211;stop &lt;integer between 10-100&gt;): Finishes a job partway through the process. Stopping a job at an earlier percentage can create blurrier, less detailed results. Model Version (&#8211;version or &#8211;v &lt;1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 5.1&gt;): Uses a different version of the Midjourney algorithm. The current algorithm (V5.1) is the default setting. Stylize (&#8211;stylize &lt;number&gt; or &#8211;s &lt;number&gt;): Influences how strongly Midjourney&#8217;s default aesthetic style is applied to jobs. This parameter accepts a number from 0 to 1000, where 0 produces images that more closely resemble the input prompt and 1000 produces images with the strongest default Midjourney aesthetic style Upscalers (&#8211;uplight, &#8211;upbeta, &#8211;upanime): Adds additional details to the low-resolution image grid.
