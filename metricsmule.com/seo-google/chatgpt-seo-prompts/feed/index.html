					<description><![CDATA[For the person requesting a password generating program to generate new password when needed, here is what ChatGPT came up with when I requested that information:

Creating a fully functional tool with storage capabilities is beyond the scope of a text-based conversation. However, I can provide you with a basic password generator algorithm in Python that meets your requirements. You can build upon this algorithm and implement additional features according to your needs:

python
Copy code
import random
import string

def generate_password(length=12, include_letters=True, include_numbers=True, include_special_chars=True):
    characters = &#039;&#039;
    if include_letters:
        characters += string.ascii_letters
    if include_numbers:
        characters += string.digits
    if include_special_chars:
        characters += string.punctuation

    password = &#039;&#039;.join(random.choice(characters) for _ in range(length))
    return password

# Example usage
length = int(input(&quot;Enter the desired password length: &quot;))
include_letters = input(&quot;Include letters? (y/n): &quot;).lower() == &#039;y&#039;
include_numbers = input(&quot;Include numbers? (y/n): &quot;).lower() == &#039;y&#039;
include_special_chars = input(&quot;Include special characters? (y/n): &quot;).lower() == &#039;y&#039;

password = generate_password(length, include_letters, include_numbers, include_special_chars)
print(&quot;Generated Password:&quot;, password)

This code allows users to specify the desired password length and select whether to include letters, numbers, and special characters. The generate_password function generates a random password based on the selected parameters. You can further enhance this code by adding a user interface and implementing secure storage mechanisms to store the generated passwords, such as using a password manager or encrypting the stored passwords.]]></description>

There are password keepers. I used to have one that I kept on a USB Drive.
Firefox has its own Password generator / storage system that&#039;s free.]]></description>

That&#039;s a great question and idea, and one that I think will be very helpful. I&#039;m interested in that myself. Let me look into that and see if we can come up with something.]]></description>
